# Node UPC Scanner
This package isn't building a whole UPC scanner, it's taking an existing reader (via USB and new lines) and turning the value it entered into some kind of actionable result.

## My usage.
I will be using this package to send the data to an extenal server for building a shopping list. Ultimately I want to build something like the amazon dash wand, but customizable.
